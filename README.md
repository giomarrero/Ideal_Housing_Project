# Ideal_Housing_Project
Georgia Tech CSE 6242 Project

This project was done alongside with Radha Avudaiappan, Ryan Rowland, Nicholas Seager, & Luke Burdette. The goal of this project was to generate an interactive map that can connect people who are looking for a new place to live in the United States of America, along with their personal interests and preferences for their new home. The factors taken into account were composite scores for the following categories: Health, Living Standards, Education, Safety, Economic Development, Ecosystem, & Nature. The interactive tool also provided users the ability to filter within states and also the users provided budget as well.
